# Getting Started Collaborating

## How to install

### Linux
To get started first install:

```bash
sudo apt install libffi-dev libnacl-dev python3-dev pip
python3 -m pip install -U nextcord captcha
```

Once installed then use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JORBONJIOVANNA/CyberSocBOT.git
```


## Documentation

The bot currently uses nextcord api, a fork of the discord.py api to handle the messaging and server activity. Due to this please refer to the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [nextcord](https://docs.nextcord.dev/en/stable/) docs. I honestly however would use these pages as a last result. Both pages can be very slow and may not be responsive at times. If you can use Youtube, stack overflow, etc. The bot also uses the captcha library to generate visual captchas.
